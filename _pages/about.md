I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Microelectronic Thrust at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Shanshi Huang](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/HUANG-Shanshi/shanshihuang) and [Prof. Wei Zhang](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/eeweiz) (IEEE Fellow). 

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Electronic Design Automation (EDA)** and **AI Hardware**, with a specific focus on **Design for ML Accelerators** and **Efficient AI Algorithms**. I am dedicated to exploring heterogeneous computing architectures and mixed-signal compute-in-memory technologies to address the efficiency bottlenecks in modern AI workloads.

Prior to my Ph.D., I obtained my M.Eng degree from Southern University of Science and Technology (2023) and B.Eng degree from Zhengzhou University (2021).
